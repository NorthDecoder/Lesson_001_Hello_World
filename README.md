# Lesson_001_Hello_World
This is the first Python program and exercise. In this lesson, we write the code to have Python reply to us with "Hello World!". 

In this jupyter notebook lesson and exercise, we introduce you to the PRINT function in Python. This is your first command and first coding syntax that you learn. It is also one of the most often used commands that you will use in your coding career. While jupyter notebooks does allow some outputting of data without the PRINT command, for more than 99% of your output you will need to use the PRINT command to see the results of your work.

Unlike other languages where the PRINT command actually prints out the results in a physical, paper based, hard copy, Python does not do this. We will learn how to move some results to a piece of paper much later in the lessons as that is an advanced technique. 

In this jupyter notebook, as well as all of our following notebooks, we will use Python 3.6 or later. You will run across Python 2.xx in your programming career, but we will not be working in this early version of Python, mostly because it is depreciating (going away). And while as of this writing Python 3.7 is out, the commands that you learn in Python 3.6x will easily transfer to the newer Python. It needs to be noted that since Python 3.6 is an older version, the bugs have been worked out of it; it is a stable platform, thus we will be using it in our work.

We strongly recommend that you purchase "Learn Python 3 the Hard Way" by Zed A. Shaw and "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes. Both of these are available at Amazon.com.
