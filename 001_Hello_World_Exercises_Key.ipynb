    "# How do I become a great programmer?\n",
    "\n",
    "The old adage that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to master a skill applies in answering the question of becoming a great programmer. Good programming skills are a combination of both knowing the language you are trying to master and thinking like a programmer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking like a programmer is to think in a methodical, linear fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking like a programmer is to accept that you do not, and will not, know everything about a programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking like a programmer is to be perpetually curious and wanting to seek new information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking like a programmer is to not assume any action will be taken; a computer will only do what you tell it to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking like a programmer is to see the world around you in a different way. Computers are linear in their thinking and actions, and programmers take a non-linear world, then restructure it into a linear set of instructions, and finally write the correct syntax to have the computer understand what you want it to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, thinking like a programmer is to understand that learning and using a computer language is parishable knowledge. It is exactly the same as learning a foreign language. You can read every book about a language, but without speaking and writing it, you will never learn it. Learning Python is the same. You ***must*** use the language daily to learn it. \n",

    "# The Zen of Python\n",

Software engineer Tim Peters wrote this set of principles and posted it on the Python mailing list in 1999. Peters's list left open a 20th principle \"for Guido to fill in\", referring to Guido Van Rossum, the original author of the Python language. The vacancy for a 20th principle has not been filled.\n",
